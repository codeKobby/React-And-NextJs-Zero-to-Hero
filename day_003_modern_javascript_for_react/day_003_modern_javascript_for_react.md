## Start here

This lesson is one step in a connected path. Start with the [course README](../README.md), confirm the [setup guide](../SETUP.md), and use the [day index](../DAY_INDEX.md) to see the phase. Choose the appropriate local fixture from the [examples guide](../examples/README.md). Work locally with synthetic data only. The learning loop for today is: We will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. Run the first example unchanged, write a prediction, make one purposeful change, reproduce the stated mistake, repair it, and complete only the practice that fits this concept.

## Why this lesson exists

The learner problem comes first: Learners need a concrete reason to study modern javascript for react before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. This lesson teaches **Modern JavaScript for React** through a connected sequence rather than a finished file dropped from the sky: We will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The goal is to explain the decision and its owner, not to memorize a spelling.

## Prerequisites

Complete the previous lesson and confirm the [setup guide](../SETUP.md). Today's minimum prerequisites are **the previous lesson, the setup guide, and the smallest prerequisite named in the opening**. If a command fails, stop at the first error and record the directory and command before changing anything. Use the [examples guide](../examples/README.md) to choose the starter; do not add a database, authentication provider, or unrelated dependency unless this lesson explicitly makes that boundary its subject.

## Outcomes

By the end, you should be able to explain the main idea in your own words, show the normal and broken behavior, trace the important values, predict a boundary result, and apply **modern javascript for react** to a small local fixture that demonstrates modern javascript for react. You should be able to name the owner and boundary—the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson—and state what the example does not prove about production readiness, security, accessibility, performance, or correctness.

## Keywords and terms

| Keyword or term | Plain-English meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `expression` | JavaScript syntax that evaluates to a value and can often appear inside JSX braces. |
| `destructuring` | JavaScript syntax that extracts named properties or positions into local variables. |
| `spread` | Syntax that copies values into a new array or object so an update can preserve existing data. |
| `map` | An array method that returns one transformed value for every input item. |
| `promise` | A JavaScript object representing a value that may become available or fail later. |
| `async` | JavaScript syntax for a function that returns a promise and can await asynchronous work. |
| `immutability` | Updating by creating a new value instead of changing the existing value in place. |

## Topics

### Which JavaScript expressions appear in JSX?

Study **Which JavaScript expressions appear in JSX** by naming its input, operation, visible result, and owner. The problem underneath this lesson is that learners need a concrete reason to study modern javascript for react before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. In this course's sequence, we will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The relevant boundary is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

**Try it before moving on:** Point to the exact line or file where this idea appears, then explain its input, visible result, and owner in your own words.

### Why does map return a new array?

The answer to **Why does map return a new array** must be earned through a visible comparison, not memorized as a slogan. The problem underneath this lesson is that learners need a concrete reason to study modern javascript for react before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. In this course's sequence, we will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The relevant boundary is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

**Try it before moving on:** Compare the smallest working case with the failure case. Record the trade-off and explain why the wrong choice would be costly for a small local fixture that demonstrates modern javascript for react.

### What does immutability mean?

Start with the learner's concrete question: **What does immutability mean**. The problem underneath this lesson is that learners need a concrete reason to study modern javascript for react before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. In this course's sequence, we will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The relevant boundary is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

**Try it before moving on:** Point to the exact line or file where this idea appears, then explain its input, visible result, and owner in your own words.

### Which JavaScript mistakes look like React mistakes?

Study **Which JavaScript mistakes look like React mistakes** by naming its input, operation, visible result, and owner. The problem underneath this lesson is that learners need a concrete reason to study modern javascript for react before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. In this course's sequence, we will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The relevant boundary is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

**Try it before moving on:** Point to the exact line or file where this idea appears, then explain its input, visible result, and owner in your own words.

## Worked example

The worked example is the smallest useful fixture for this day. Copy it into the appropriate starter file, run it unchanged, and write down what you see before you improve it. The example is deliberately bounded: We will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture.

```tsx
const names = ['Ada', 'Lin'];
const labels = names.map((name) => `User: ${name}`);
console.log(labels);
```

**Expected result or visible behavior:**

```text
[ 'User: Ada', 'User: Lin' ]
```

Before changing the code, point to its input, operation, visible output, and owner. If the code is JSX, distinguish JavaScript expressions from markup. If it runs in Next.js, identify whether the file is a Server Component, Client Component, Route Handler, Server Action, or Proxy fixture. The exact boundary to inspect today is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

## Line-by-line explanation

| Line | What this line does |
| ---: | --- |
| 1 | `const names = ['Ada', 'Lin'];` — Creates a named value from the expression on the right; record its input, lifetime, and owner in this day's example. |
| 2 | `const labels = names.map((name) => `User: ${name}`);` — Transforms each record into a rendered or returned value; the key or identity decision should be inspected with the collection. |
| 3 | `console.log(labels);` — Writes an observation so the learner can compare runtime evidence with the prediction; console output is not the same as screen output. |

Use the table as a starting point, not as a substitute for running the code. Add a note beside any line whose behavior differs between a browser, React, and Next.js server environment.

## Execution trace

1. Start with the fixture's initial input: Learners need a concrete reason to study modern javascript for react before the terminology becomes useful.
2. Follow the code until the first meaningful decision. Name the value, component, route, or server function that owns it.
3. Observe the event, render, request, update, or boundary that changes the result. This lesson's central sequence is: We will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture.
4. Compare the actual output with your prediction and identify the smallest reason for any mismatch.
5. Treat the result as evidence about this local fixture, not proof that an untested production application is secure, accessible, performant, or correct.

Write the trace in your own notebook. Include the before value, the operation, the after value or response, and the boundary where authority changes.

## Prediction experiment

Before running the experiment, write your prediction. Change exactly one input or boundary related to **Modern JavaScript for React**. Use a normal alternative first, then a boundary such as an empty value, invalid value, loading condition, missing route parameter, rejected action, unauthorized actor, or reordered record when it fits the lesson. Predict the visible output or error, run it, and explain the difference. Restore the original case to prove the repair preserved the normal behavior.

## Broken example and repair

A deliberate failure is part of the lesson. **Broken version:** Mutate the original array, observe the change, and repair the code with a copied array.

Run the broken version in a local copy. The likely beginner mistake for this family is: Copy the syntax without identifying the input, owner, output, and boundary. Capture the error or incorrect UI, name the violated assumption, and repair the smallest meaningful line or boundary. Rerun the normal case and one boundary case. Do not hide the failure with a broad catch, disable a type check, or call a passing render proof of authorization, accessibility, or security.

## Guided practice before independent work

First, reproduce the worked example unchanged. Second, change one input while keeping the rule fixed and record the visible difference. Third, reproduce the likely mistake and repair it with the smallest change. Fourth, start from the bounded local fixture and apply **modern javascript for react** to a small local fixture that demonstrates modern javascript for react. Before independent work, answer: what is the owner, what crosses the boundary, what is the normal case, and what should happen when the work is empty, invalid, loading, rejected, or unauthorized?

## Project application

Apply the lesson to a small local fixture that demonstrates modern javascript for react using the local fixture from the [examples guide](../examples/README.md). Name the user-visible goal, the owner, the data shape, the normal case, and the boundary case. The key boundary to document is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson. If the work touches a secret, database, cookie, authentication, or authorization decision, keep it server-side and test an unauthorized synthetic actor. If it is React-only, use invented data and do not send it to a public service.

## Independent exercises

1. Define **Which JavaScript expressions appear in JSX?** in your own words and point to its first concrete example.
2. Run the smallest worked example unchanged and record the expected and observed result.
3. Trace the important values, operations, output, and owner line by line.
4. Change one input while preserving the rule for **Why does map return a new array?**, then predict before running.
5. Create a boundary case involving **What does immutability mean?** and choose deliberate behavior.
6. Reproduce the deliberate failure: Mutate the original array, observe the change, and repair the code with a copied array.
7. Repair the smallest meaningful line or boundary and rerun normal and boundary cases.
8. Add one accessibility, type, loading, error, or server/client quality requirement.
9. Add a focused assertion that fails when the important behavior disappears.
10. Apply modern javascript for react to a small local fixture that demonstrates modern javascript for react with a local synthetic fixture.
11. Explain the owner and boundary: the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.
12. Write a review note with evidence, one limitation, and the next learning step.

## Finish line

You are finished when you can teach **Modern JavaScript for React** to another beginner, show the normal and broken runs, explain the repair, and point to **the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson**. You should be able to name one limitation and one piece of evidence that would be required before making a production claim. Do not move on because the code merely compiles.

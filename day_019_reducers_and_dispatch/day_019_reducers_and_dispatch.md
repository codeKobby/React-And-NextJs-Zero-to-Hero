## Start here

This lesson is one step in a connected path. Start with the [course README](../README.md), confirm the [setup guide](../SETUP.md), and use the [day index](../DAY_INDEX.md) to see the phase. Choose the appropriate local fixture from the [examples guide](../examples/README.md). Work locally with synthetic data only. The learning loop for today is: We will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. Run the first example unchanged, write a prediction, make one purposeful change, reproduce the stated mistake, repair it, and complete only the practice that fits this concept.

## Why this lesson exists

The learner problem comes first: Learners need a concrete reason to study reducers and dispatch before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. This lesson teaches **Reducers and dispatch** through a connected sequence rather than a finished file dropped from the sky: We will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The goal is to explain the decision and its owner, not to memorize a spelling.

## Prerequisites

Complete the previous lesson and confirm the [setup guide](../SETUP.md). Today's minimum prerequisites are **the previous lesson, the setup guide, and the smallest prerequisite named in the opening**. If a command fails, stop at the first error and record the directory and command before changing anything. Use the [examples guide](../examples/README.md) to choose the starter; do not add a database, authentication provider, or unrelated dependency unless this lesson explicitly makes that boundary its subject.

## Outcomes

By the end, you should be able to explain the main idea in your own words, show the normal and broken behavior, trace the important values, predict a boundary result, and apply **reducers and dispatch** to a small local fixture that demonstrates reducers and dispatch. You should be able to name the owner and boundary—the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson—and state what the example does not prove about production readiness, security, accessibility, performance, or correctness.

## Keywords and terms

| Keyword or term | Plain-English meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `reducer` | A pure function that calculates the next state from the current state and a named action. |
| `action` | A named unit of work that can have pending, success, error, or optimistic behavior. |
| `dispatch` | The operation of sending an action to a reducer or state machine for a next state decision. |
| `pure function` | A function whose result depends only on its inputs and which does not mutate outside state. |
| `state transition` | The change from one named UI or data state to another after an event or operation. |

## Topics

### What is a reducer?

Start with the learner's concrete question: **What is a reducer**. The problem underneath this lesson is that learners need a concrete reason to study reducers and dispatch before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. In this course's sequence, we will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The relevant boundary is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

**Try it before moving on:** Point to the exact line or file where this idea appears, then explain its input, visible result, and owner in your own words.

### Why name state transitions as actions?

The answer to **Why name state transitions as actions** must be earned through a visible comparison, not memorized as a slogan. The problem underneath this lesson is that learners need a concrete reason to study reducers and dispatch before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. In this course's sequence, we will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The relevant boundary is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

**Try it before moving on:** Compare the smallest working case with the failure case. Record the trade-off and explain why the wrong choice would be costly for a small local fixture that demonstrates reducers and dispatch.

### What makes a reducer pure?

Start with the learner's concrete question: **What makes a reducer pure**. The problem underneath this lesson is that learners need a concrete reason to study reducers and dispatch before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. In this course's sequence, we will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The relevant boundary is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

**Try it before moving on:** Point to the exact line or file where this idea appears, then explain its input, visible result, and owner in your own words.

### When is useReducer clearer than useState?

Treat **When is useReducer clearer than useState** as a decision that has a normal case, a boundary case, and a cost when chosen carelessly. The problem underneath this lesson is that learners need a concrete reason to study reducers and dispatch before the terminology becomes useful. A small workshop task gives the learner something visible to change before the tool's name matters. In this course's sequence, we will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture. The relevant boundary is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

**Try it before moving on:** Write a decision rule with one normal case and one boundary case. Include what would make the other option preferable.

## Worked example

The worked example is the smallest useful fixture for this day. Copy it into the appropriate starter file, run it unchanged, and write down what you see before you improve it. The example is deliberately bounded: We will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture.

```tsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'add') return [...state, action.item];
  return state;
}
```

**Expected result or visible behavior:**

```text
The reducer returns the next state.
```

Before changing the code, point to its input, operation, visible output, and owner. If the code is JSX, distinguish JavaScript expressions from markup. If it runs in Next.js, identify whether the file is a Server Component, Client Component, Route Handler, Server Action, or Proxy fixture. The exact boundary to inspect today is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.

## Line-by-line explanation

| Line | What this line does |
| ---: | --- |
| 1 | `function reducer(state, action) {` — Declares a callable behavior or component boundary; note its inputs, owner, and when the runtime invokes it. |
| 2 | `if (action.type === 'add') return [...state, action.item];` — Guards the next behavior with a deliberate condition; this is where the example chooses a normal, empty, invalid, or unauthorized path. |
| 3 | `return state;` — Returns the value or UI tree owned by the surrounding function; the next visible result follows from this return. |
| 4 | `}` — Runs inside the current example; connect its effect to the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson. |

Use the table as a starting point, not as a substitute for running the code. Add a note beside any line whose behavior differs between a browser, React, and Next.js server environment.

## Execution trace

1. Start with the fixture's initial input: Learners need a concrete reason to study reducers and dispatch before the terminology becomes useful.
2. Follow the code until the first meaningful decision. Name the value, component, route, or server function that owns it.
3. Observe the event, render, request, update, or boundary that changes the result. This lesson's central sequence is: We will run a smallest example, change one input, inspect the result, reproduce a likely mistake, and apply the idea to a local fixture.
4. Compare the actual output with your prediction and identify the smallest reason for any mismatch.
5. Treat the result as evidence about this local fixture, not proof that an untested production application is secure, accessible, performant, or correct.

Write the trace in your own notebook. Include the before value, the operation, the after value or response, and the boundary where authority changes.

## Prediction experiment

Before running the experiment, write your prediction. Change exactly one input or boundary related to **Reducers and dispatch**. Use a normal alternative first, then a boundary such as an empty value, invalid value, loading condition, missing route parameter, rejected action, unauthorized actor, or reordered record when it fits the lesson. Predict the visible output or error, run it, and explain the difference. Restore the original case to prove the repair preserved the normal behavior.

## Broken example and repair

A deliberate failure is part of the lesson. **Broken version:** Mutate the reducer's state array and repair it with a new array.

Run the broken version in a local copy. The likely beginner mistake for this family is: Copy the syntax without identifying the input, owner, output, and boundary. Capture the error or incorrect UI, name the violated assumption, and repair the smallest meaningful line or boundary. Rerun the normal case and one boundary case. Do not hide the failure with a broad catch, disable a type check, or call a passing render proof of authorization, accessibility, or security.

## Guided practice before independent work

First, reproduce the worked example unchanged. Second, change one input while keeping the rule fixed and record the visible difference. Third, reproduce the likely mistake and repair it with the smallest change. Fourth, start from the bounded local fixture and apply **reducers and dispatch** to a small local fixture that demonstrates reducers and dispatch. Before independent work, answer: what is the owner, what crosses the boundary, what is the normal case, and what should happen when the work is empty, invalid, loading, rejected, or unauthorized?

## Project application

Apply the lesson to a small local fixture that demonstrates reducers and dispatch using the local fixture from the [examples guide](../examples/README.md). Name the user-visible goal, the owner, the data shape, the normal case, and the boundary case. The key boundary to document is the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson. If the work touches a secret, database, cookie, authentication, or authorization decision, keep it server-side and test an unauthorized synthetic actor. If it is React-only, use invented data and do not send it to a public service.

## Independent exercises

1. Run the smallest state example and record the initial visible snapshot.
2. Trigger one update and trace event, setter or dispatch, and next render.
3. Change one input and predict the new output before running it.
4. Create a normal boundary such as empty, reset, or zero state.
5. Reproduce the likely state ownership or mutation mistake.
6. Repair it with the smallest state-structure change.
7. Compare the current state value with the source that derives it.
8. Add a user-visible status or accessible announcement for the transition.
9. Add an assertion or test for normal and boundary behavior.
10. Apply the lesson to a small local fixture that demonstrates reducers and dispatch using synthetic data.
11. Explain why the state belongs at the the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson.
12. Write a review note naming the next complexity that would justify a different tool.

## Finish line

You are finished when you can teach **Reducers and dispatch** to another beginner, show the normal and broken runs, explain the repair, and point to **the code or framework boundary that owns the decision in this lesson**. You should be able to name one limitation and one piece of evidence that would be required before making a production claim. Do not move on because the code merely compiles.
